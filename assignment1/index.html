                    India, officially the Republic of India, is a country in South Asia and the world's most populous
                    nation as of June 2023. It is the seventh-largest country by area and has a rich history dating back
                    55,000 years. India shares borders with Pakistan, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, and
                    is surrounded by the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, and Bay of Bengal. <br><br>

                    India’s diverse culture stems from ancient civilizations, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and
                    Sikhism originating here. Over time, the country was shaped by the Maurya and Gupta Empires, Islamic
                    influence during the Delhi Sultanate, and later Mughal rule. British colonization led to India's
                    independence in 1947 after a successful nonviolent nationalist movement. <br><br>

                    Since becoming a federal republic in 1950, India has evolved into a major economy and global IT hub,
                    while also advancing in space exploration. Though it faces challenges such as poverty reduction,
                    gender inequality, and environmental issues, India remains a megadiverse country with a rich
                    cultural heritage and a growing influence on the global stage.

                        Ancient India is one of the earliest cradles of human civilization, with a history that
                        stretches back tens of thousands of years. From the early arrival of modern humans to the
                        flourishing of the Indus Valley Civilization and the development of major world religions like
                        Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, ancient India was a hub of culture, trade, and intellectual
                        advancement. The Mauryan and Gupta empires marked significant periods of political unity and
                        cultural growth, leaving a lasting legacy in areas such as art, science, and architecture. <br>

                    <p id="anc-text">Medieval India</p>
                    <p> <br>
                        The early medieval age in India (600-1200 CE) was characterized by regional kingdoms and
                        cultural diversity. Rulers like Harsha of Kannauj attempted territorial expansion but faced
                        defeats from the Chalukyas, Pala king of Bengal, and other southern powers. No single ruler
                        established a vast empire, and during this time, pastoral communities and new ruling classes
                        were incorporated into a regional caste system that began to show distinct differences. <br><br>

                        The 6th and 7th centuries saw the emergence of devotional hymns in Tamil, which sparked a
                        resurgence of Hinduism and influenced the development of modern Indian languages. Temple towns
                        began to proliferate, turning capital cities into economic hubs. This cultural and economic
                        growth extended beyond India, impacting Southeast Asia, where South Indian culture and political
                        systems were introduced, facilitated by Indian merchants and scholars. <br><br>

                        After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans invaded North India, leading to the
                        establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206. Initially disruptive, the sultanate
                        allowed non-Muslim subjects to maintain their customs and laws while defending India against
                        Mongol raids. This period of upheaval eventually paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara
                        Empire, which thrived on Shaivite traditions and military technology, influencing South Indian
                        society for generations. <br><br>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="modern">
                    <p id="anc-text">Modern India</p>
                    <p> <br>
                        India's modern age is generally considered to have begun between 1848 and 1885, marked by
                        significant changes under Lord Dalhousie's governance of the East India Company. His reforms
                        included the consolidation of sovereignty, population surveillance, and education initiatives,
                        alongside technological advancements like railways and telegraphs. However, dissatisfaction with
                        the
                        Company grew, culminating in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, driven by resentment over British
                        social
                        reforms, heavy land taxes, and the treatment of landowners. Though suppressed by 1858, the
                        rebellion
                        led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the establishment of direct British rule,
                        which
                        introduced a limited parliamentary system while maintaining the power of local princes. <br><br>

                        The latter half of the 19th century saw technological progress and the commercialization of
                        agriculture, but small farmers often struggled due to dependence on distant markets, leading to
                        frequent famines. Despite the risks of infrastructure development, little industrial employment
                        was
                        created for Indians, though commercial cropping in regions like Punjab improved food production
                        and
                        the railway network facilitated famine relief and reduced transportation costs. <br><br>

                        Following World War I, with about a million Indians serving, a new era emerged characterized by
                        British reforms and repressive measures. This period saw intensified calls for self-rule and the
                        rise of nonviolent resistance led by Mahatma Gandhi. The 1930s brought slow legislative changes,
                        with the Indian National Congress achieving electoral victories. However, the 1940s were marked
                        by
                        crises, including India's participation in World War II and the intensification of Muslim
                        nationalism, ultimately leading to independence in 1947 and the partition into India and
                        Pakistan. <br><br>

                        The completion of India’s constitution in 1950 established a secular and democratic republic,
                        making
                        it the first republic in the Commonwealth. Economic liberalization beginning in the 1980s
                        fostered
                        the growth of a large urban middle class and transformed India into one of the fastest-growing
                        economies globally. Nonetheless, challenges persist, including pervasive poverty, religious and
                        caste-related violence, Naxalite insurgencies, and territorial disputes with China and Pakistan.
                        While India’s democratic freedoms stand out among emerging nations, the struggle to ensure
                        freedom
                        from want for disadvantaged populations remains ongoing. <br><br>

                    Cultural diversity in India is one of the country's defining characteristics, shaped by its long
                    history and the coexistence of various ethnicities, languages, religions, and traditions. With over
                    2,000 distinct ethnic groups and more than 1,600 spoken languages, India is a mosaic of cultures
                    that reflects its rich heritage. <br><br>

                    The major religions practiced in India—Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, and
                    Jainism—each contribute unique beliefs, practices, and festivals, fostering a landscape of vibrant
                    traditions. This diversity is also evident in India's art forms, cuisine, music, dance, and
                    clothing, which vary widely across regions and communities. For instance, while the folk dances of
                    Punjab, like Bhangra, differ significantly from the classical Bharatanatyam of Tamil Nadu, they both
                    showcase India's rich artistic expressions. <br><br>

                    Cultural diversity in India promotes social cohesion and fosters mutual respect among different
                    communities, but it can also lead to tensions and conflicts. Efforts to celebrate and preserve this
                    diversity are crucial, as they enhance national identity and promote harmony in a country
                    characterized by its pluralism. Festivals like Diwali, Eid, Christmas, and Baisakhi are celebrated
                    by various communities, highlighting the spirit of unity in diversity that defines India.
